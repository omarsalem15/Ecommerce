# M-commerce

Welcome to the README file for the M-Commerce Project! This document will provide you with an overview of the project's features, technologies used, and instructions on how to get started.

## Project Overview
The M-Commerce Project is a mobile commerce application that allows users to explore and purchase a wide range of products conveniently from their mobile devices. This project showcases various products, provides category-based filtering, and incorporates user authentication for seamless login and registration.


## Features

1. **Showcased Products with Category Filtering**: Users can view a diverse collection of products that are categorized. The category filtering feature enables users to quickly narrow down their product preferences.

2. **Integrated Firebase for Login and Registration**: Firebase authentication is used to manage user accounts. Users can create accounts, log in securely, and access personalized features.

3. **MVC Architecture**: The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, enhancing code organization and maintainability.

4. **Restful APIs**: Restful APIs are utilized to fetch and display product information from a backend database, ensuring efficient data retrieval.

5. **CollectionView and TableView**: The user interface incorporates CollectionView and TableView to present products and information in an organized and visually appealing manner.

6. **Cart Screen with Product Quantity and Total Price**: The Cart screen displays each product's quantity and price, as well as the total price of all selected products.

7. **XIB Files**: Interface layout and design are managed using XIB files, enhancing the separation of UI from code logic.

8. **CocoaPods (SDWebImage)**: The CocoaPods dependency manager is used to integrate the SDWebImage library, facilitating the asynchronous loading and caching of product images.

9. **Responsive Design with AutoLayout**: The user interface is designed using AutoLayout, ensuring that screens fit seamlessly on all iPhone devices.
